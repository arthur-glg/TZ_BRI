# Resume 
First we talked about the administration setup of this research program : TZ or TX starting this week and ending in febuary for 4 ECTS. After we discussed the setting for this study. It will mostly be focused on identifying actors and projects linked to the devellopement of smart cities which results from a collaboration or an exchange of skills with China. 

# Note 
- This is qualitative work that could take the form of a actors' data card and a project data card.
- We may focus first on Laos, because a team is already working on it. At some point someone can do interview with the identified actors. 
- [[Adèle Esposito]] and [[Natacha Aveline]] are two people working on this subject.

# After task
- [X] Check the works of [[Adèle Esposito]] and [[Natacha Aveline]]
- [x] Check  [[LAOS.pdf]] document and osint a bit about Laos
