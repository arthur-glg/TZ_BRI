B-->C[Overall view]
```
First we need to learn about the projects to describe the investments made and the urban technology deployed. With this first "wave" of information we will know better about the investors. Who they are? Where they come from? What the benfits they are making? At the end, all of those information will create a overall view of the our subject.
# Note
- On the project sheet add all the question we have to undersand the limits of out studies, and the urban technology deployed to know about the expertise brang by Chinese companies. Pictures of the projects are also important to see if these are exports of projects already completed in China. 
- Change "Conglomerate" -> "Parent company " or "Chinese multinational"
- Maybe check about the call for tender for each projects 
- 02/11/2021 -> Big meeting and presentation about Real estate, tourism and transport in Laos.
