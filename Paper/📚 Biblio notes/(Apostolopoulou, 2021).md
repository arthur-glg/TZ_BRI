# A novel geographical research agenda on Silk Road urbanisation
Infrastruture and industrial projets -> transforming urban spaces arcross the global south and north, changing the social and urban geographies of cities -> **The Silk Road urbanisation**

- BRI create massive urban transformation (intensification of urbanisation) on purpose of creating new economical links (trades corridors). There is transformation and creation of cities.

- the vast majority of the literature that deals with urbanisation along the New Silk Road comes from the natural sciences and adopts a strictly quantitative approach
(e.g., Liu et al., 2018; Muhammad et al., 2020)
```

BRI initiative may be the Chinese response the 2008 global economic crash -> A new stimulation that will support infrastructure devellopment. 

- No official cartography of the BRI (Narins & Agnew, 2020)

- *Strategic combination of special economic zones (SEZs) with transport infrastructure and investments in the built environment, further confirm the above tendencies by manifesting a clear aim to use large-scale infrastructure to facilitate transnational trade and boost urban growth.*
- *reduce spatial barriers to facilitate capital flows by integrating subnational urban systems into transnational territories through networked infrastructure mega-projects* (Schindler and Kanai, 2021)
- *strategic combination of transport infrastructure, trade corridors, housing and commercial projects, with SEZs, industrial parks and smart cities* -> dropping **smart cities** but no further more 

<u>China's New Urbanisation Plan :</u>
- characterised by a combination of urban-rural integration 
- enhance the nodal roles of global cities 
-> This patterns can be found in Silk Roads cities 
-> Pushing extensive land acquisitions and expropriations, creating urban inequalities (wich one ? -> (Apostolopoulou, 2021a, 2021b))

- *setting up SEZs and industrial parks with initiating new urban business districts, real-estate developments and urban regeneration projects, and the central role of state-owned enterprises (Hsing, 2010; Jiang & Waley, 2020).*

- it also underlines the need for research approaches that would explicitly focus on understanding how the BRIâ€™s uneven geographies influence patterns of urban inequality. In the limited number of existing grounded analyses, a focus on urban areas and cities is rare
```

- *Silk Road urbanisation transforms the entire urban fabric by reconfiguring cities as nodes of transnational trade, wealth, and entrepreneurship*
- *the establishment of the first SEZ based on the principles of the Shenzhen model, led to the establishment of foreign, including Chinese, enterprises*

-> Also mentionning the fact that Silk Road renamed cities 
*l to rename places according to the cities they wish to resemble, foreclosing more inclusive imaginaries of urban futures (McFarlane, 2010)* linked with [[(Otmakhova, 2018)]]

- Even though Silk Road urbanisation is a highly contested process that is fashioned by local social relations and power struggles, comparisons of social struggles across Silk Road cities, including urban struggles and everyday practices of resistance in Chinese cities, are absent from the literature
