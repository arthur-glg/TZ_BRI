## about labor

-> BRI project in Laos rely mostly on chinese workforce especially on the constuction sector (railway, hydropower). 
-> Based on intrviews of sub-contractors, low-skilled jobs performed by chinese. Laos people were only involved in early phases. 
Why ? Some instability from Laos government into the incoming money, protestation from Laos worker who left. Chinese workers replaced them with a system of wages only every six month to cover instabilities.
