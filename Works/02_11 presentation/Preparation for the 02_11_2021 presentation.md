# Introduction 
-> My research is based on the work of Julein Muselet who did a first quantitative treatment of the China Global Investment tracker database.
-> My works will focus on the qualitative analysis if the chinese stakeholders investing for the devellopement of BRI. 
-> I'm basically doing some project and investor sheet to understand the way chinese companies invest. What are the contributions of this companies in the field of urban engineering. 
-> As this meeting is about Laos, I'll present you my methodology to identified a project and my first results. 

**Investments per investors, per sector**
- Laos still follow the same scheme for developping countries with massive investments coming from state owned companies in hydropower and rail.
- There is no property, every investment in real estate concerns construction.
- Non state owned companues are concentrated around Real esate
 
**Investments per investors, per sector, in real estate and transport **
- Once again it perfectly fit what we can expect from a developing country.
- The focus in transport is made around train rather than auto. 

# Methodology 
-> Presentation of the database : China Global Investment Tracker (from AIE)
https://www.aei.org/china-global-investment-tracker/

-><u>Database entry</u>
Year|Month|Investor|Quantity in millions|Share size|Transaction party|Sector|Subsector|Country|Region|BRI|Greenfield|
These data will be our identification keys 
-><u>What informations we are looking for</u>
+project name
+type
+location
+parent comagny
+delivery date

**The two methods of identifying a project**
-><u>Cross-referencing of press articles</u>

-><u>Analysis of official documents and matching to articles </u>

# Conlcusion 
## results 
- I find a working method for identifying projects from the data base (find 100% of the transport, real-estate and tourism entry). 
- Railway is a keystone in the BRI devellopement, but over the 2030 horizon, the SEZ will represent an almost equivalent investment.
- A degree of accuracy is gained by knowing the type of infrastructure. For example for real-estate sector we have SEZ and production infrastructure (cement plant). 
- There is a link between these projects: Jixiang cement factory is helping to build the China-Laos railway line that will serve Saysettha SEZ industries.


## limitation 
- I think the bigest limit is the language barrier. Most article i read are short one displaying basic information. Even the english official statement do not elaborate on construction methods, planning, Chinese expertise. 
- Database relayability, we do not have info of how it was made, no sources etc. And during my research I found some mistakes or some unclear entry, not the same amount invested or wrong date. But the most important, the data base do not showcase all of the project, and not small one that could go under our radar
