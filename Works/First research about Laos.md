# First research about Laos 
*First research around [[LAOS.pdf]] document (summary by Ms Henriot)*

Just a start about **Energy**. 

For example when we look at *Electricite du Laos* we can find news about the State loosing his compagny over China governance *China Southern Power Grid*-> https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/dette-le-laos-perd-le-controle-de-lentreprise-nationale-delectricite
We can understand why Electricite du Laos is a "really dominant transaction party"

Find this interesting paper [[Chinese_Companies_Energy_Activities_in_Emerging_Asia.pdf]]

ðŸŸ *I tried to track this database line :*
2016 | March | China National Machinery Industry (Sinomach) | $ 2 100 |Electricite du Laos | Energy | Laos | East Asia | 1
Nice document I found but, it do not show un details wich investment are made [[Assessment and Prospect of China-Laos Development cooperation.pdf]], I guess it can show us a nice overview. 
No really ideas or things found... 

ðŸŸ¢*I tried this other line* -> Spoiler it's about the [[Hongsa Power Plant]]
 2010 | June | China National Machinery Industry (Sinomach) | Banpu Power and Ratchaburi Electricity | Energy | Coal | Laos | East Asia
 On this annual report of 2010 from Banpu [[Annual-Report-2010_En_154207.pdf]], I found this interesting line : "Other important strategic steps in 2010 included securing USD 2.7 billion in project finance for the Hongsa coal-power project in Laos". I think 1.6 billions from Sinomach are a part of the 2.7 billion. 
 LETS GO I GOT IT ! On the news website of the sinomach : http://www.cneec.com.cn/english/NewsCenter/CNEECNews/201512/t20151223_79487.html 
 "Hongsa power plant project is a backbone project under the framework agreement for the energy cooperation between Thailand and Laos. The part of it undertaken by CNEEC involved a total investment of about $1.68 billion"
