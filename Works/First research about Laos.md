# First research about Laos 
## Introduction 
*First research around [[LAOS.pdf]] document (summary by Ms Henriot)*

Just a start about **Energy**. 

For example when we look at *Electricite du Laos* we can find news about the State loosing his compagny over China governance *China Southern Power Grid*-> https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/dette-le-laos-perd-le-controle-de-lentreprise-nationale-delectricite
We can understand why Electricite du Laos is a "really dominant transaction party"

Find this interesting paper [[Chinese_Companies_Energy_Activities_in_Emerging_Asia.pdf]]

## First research

🟠*I tried to track this database line :*
2016 | March | China National Machinery Industry (Sinomach) | $ 2 100 |Electricite du Laos | Energy | Laos | East Asia | 1
Nice document I found but, it do not show un details wich investment are made [[Assessment and Prospect of China-Laos Development cooperation.pdf]], I guess it can show us a nice overview. 
No real ideas or things found... I've got an intuition about an hydroelectric project. because there is a lot of article talking about SINOMACH investing into Nam Ou project or else

http://en.sinomach-he.cn/contents/4720/63077.html
https://www.rfa.org/english/news/special/china-build-laos-dams/
I found this one that could match -> https://www.scmp.com/article/965257/sinohydro-us2b-deal-build-dams-laos but it was in 2011... I know that Nam Ou project stated in 2016. Is it linked ? Sinohydro also apear in the dataset... And there is a line about 1,1B $ in December 2010, but no transaction party. I think this 2B$ is the deal with PowerChina also in the dataset. 
Really not cleat -> https://ppi.worldbank.org/en/snapshots/project/sinohydro-nam-ou-1-7-hpps-6120 Nam Ou constructed by Sinohydro with 2B$ but managed by PowerChina 



🟢*I tried this other line* -> Spoiler it's about the [[Hongsa Power Plant]]
 2010 | June | China National Machinery Industry (Sinomach) | $ 1 600 |Banpu Power and Ratchaburi Electricity | Energy | Coal | Laos | East Asia
 On this annual report of 2010 from Banpu [[Annual-Report-2010_En_154207.pdf]], I found this interesting line : "Other important strategic steps in 2010 included securing USD 2.7 billion in project finance for the Hongsa coal-power project in Laos". I think 1.6 billions from Sinomach are a part of the 2.7 billion. 
 LETS GO I GOT IT ! On the news website of the sinomach : http://www.cneec.com.cn/english/NewsCenter/CNEECNews/201512/t20151223_79487.html 
 "Hongsa power plant project is a backbone project under the framework agreement for the energy cooperation between Thailand and Laos. The part of it undertaken by CNEEC involved a total investment of about $1.68 billion"

## Some thinking about the form that this work will take 
![[ai_cs6_splash.png]]
It seems that we can create a graph with every conglomerate associated to investment compagny -> transaction party -> projects. We can see wich is more important, more invested in differents projects, fields that a conglomerate is investing. Links beetween differents sectors.
