# Thanks to 

I would like to thank Carine Henriot, my supervisor for this project. I enjoyed all our meetings which were moments of reflection but also discussions on other subjects at least as interesting. I would like to thank her a second time for helping me to find my final internship. And one last time for her advice on how to continue my career after my engineering degree. 

I did this research work during my Erasmus semester in Ljubljana, Slovenia. This is where I fell in love with the Germans who have been my best friends here ! Special thanks to Ann Sophie who was always proud of me when I finished my work just before the deadlines. She was also my lockdown partner when I got COVID and I never laughed as much as I did with her watching The Office. I also think of Johanna and Marie who were my hiking partners and with whom I had long conversations about this work. I don't forget my French colleagues: Valentine, Elisa, Thomas, Hugo, RÃ©my and Pierre-Louis! I guess I'll be in Lyon and Leipzig sooner than they think.
